# Flex (Fork)

This is a fork of the minimalist [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) theme named [Flex](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex), originaly made by [Alexandre Vicenzi](https://blog.alexandrevicenzi.com/).

The modified version is forked from [version 2.1.0](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex/releases/tag/v2.1.0).

## Why This Fork?

I like the original theme especially because of good SEO. Also the design is very similar to something I would like to have on my blog so I decided to fork it and modify it a little bit to better suits to my needs. I would like to many thnaks the author for the original theme.
